Instantly create a .gitignore file for your project through your command line. 

Type `ignore <project-type>` to create a .gitignore file for your project. 

Example: `ignore rust`

This will create a .gitignore file for a rust project. 

Incase, you already have a .gitignore file, recommended patterns will be appended, 
and duplicates will not be added to your existing .gitignore file. 

See `ignore --all` to see the list of supported projects.
